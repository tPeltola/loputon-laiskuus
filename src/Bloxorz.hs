-- TODO 8:
-- Returns `True` if the block `b` is at the final position
done :: Level -> Block -> Bool

-- TODO 9:
-- This function takes three arguments: the current block `b`,
-- a list of moves `history` that was required to reach the
-- position of `b` and the level that is played.
--
-- The `head` element of the `history` list is the latest move
-- that was executed, i.e. the last move that was performed for
-- the block to end up at position `b`.
--
-- The function returns a list of pairs: the first element of
-- the each pair is a neighboring block, and the second element
-- is the augmented history of moves required to reach this block.
--
-- It should only return valid neighbors, i.e. block positions
-- that are inside the terrain.
neighboursWithHistory :: Level -> [Move] -> Block -> [State]

-- TODO 10:
-- This function returns the list of neighbors without the block
-- positions that have already been explored. We will use it to
-- make sure that we don't explore circular paths.
newNeighbours :: Explored -> [State] -> [State]
newNeighbours explored neighbors = undefined

-- TODO 11:
-- The function `from` returns the infinite list of all possible paths
-- that can be followed, starting at the `head` of the `initial`
-- list.
--
-- The blocks in the list `initial` are sorted by ascending path
-- length: the block positions with the shortest paths (length of
-- move list) are at the head of the list.
--
-- The parameter `explored` is a set of block positions that have
-- been visited before, on the path to any of the blocks in the
-- list `initial`. When search reaches a block that has already
-- been explored before, that position should not be included a
-- second time to avoid circles.
--
-- The resulting list should be sorted by ascending path length,
-- i.e. the block positions that can be reached with the fewest
-- amount of moves should appear first in the list.
--
-- Note: the solution should not look at or compare the lengths
-- of different paths - the implementation should naturally
-- construct the correctly sorted list.

-- position.
